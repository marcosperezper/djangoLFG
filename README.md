#LFG API(WIP)

## Description
A project based on an API with the purpose to search a party to play videogames.
People who like videogames can find a party to play their favorite games with people, 
because all of us know that: _**It's dangerous to go alone, take this API.**_

The Gamers(users) can register on the app,and immediately they can search a party 
and start sending messages with the other gamers to play

## Set up
All the packages needed for the API are in the document "requirements.txt" and can be installed using the command :

`pip -r install requirements.txt`

##Stack

* Python as a base programing language
* Django to complete Python
* Django Rest Framework for developing the API
* PostgreSQL as a database system 
* JWT for authentication
* Git
